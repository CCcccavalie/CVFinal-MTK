#### Code
I only upload the part of GCnet, since it is my work.
I modified the work of [this](https://github.com/zyf12389/GC-Net), with only training the flyingthing3D dataset.

#### Report

You can find our work and results in the report for more detail.

#### Some of the testing data

The part of mine(GCnet) which is darker is due to the other method to visualize.
